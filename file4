What are GNPA and NNPA?
Gross NPA is the total of all assets that are classified as non-performing as per RBI guidelines.

Net NPA is the total of all non-performing assets minus the provision left aside. Provisions are the amount a bank sets aside from its profits to cover for losses that a bank may or has incurred.

So, net NPA is the amount we get after adjusting GNPA with provisions.
